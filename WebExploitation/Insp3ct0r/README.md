## Description
Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need inspection: https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/44924/ [(link)](./index.html) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:44924

This flag was really basic web page source inspection, where the flag was divided into three different sections:

2. In the [css](./mycss.css) file
3. In the [js](./myjs.js) file
