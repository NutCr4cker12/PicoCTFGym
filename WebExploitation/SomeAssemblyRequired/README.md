# Some Assembly Required

# Solution  
Started by looking at the source code of the web page where "Enter flag submission" button called a function from [javascript file](./G82XCw5CX3.js). The js file was obfuscated/minified of some sort and one could made a little more sense out of it by running it through some [online javascript deobfuscator](https://seosniffer.com/javascript-deobfuscator). Deducing from the ```onButtonPress``` function that ```document.getElementById(tarhonda(484))[tarhonda(477)]; // ==> document.getElementById("input")["value"]``` we get the correct shift for the array. Following the code one can see that a ```fetch``` call is made to get [WebAssembly file](./JIFxzHyW8W) and taking a closer look at the webassembly file by simply cattting it (don't know why I did that even though it is actual WebAssembly binary module) resulted into the flag.
