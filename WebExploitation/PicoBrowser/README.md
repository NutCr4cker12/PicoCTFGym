This website can be rendered only by picobrowser, go and catch the flag! https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/50522/ [(link)](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/50522/) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:50522
### hints
1. You don't need to download a new web browser
# Solution  
The website has a large button to display the flag, but it requires to use picobrowser. So lets try *GET* the flag with little modified ```User-Agent``` in the headers to trick the site into believing we are using "picobrowser" and the flag is ours.
