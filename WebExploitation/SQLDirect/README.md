# SQL Direct
## Description
Connect to this PostgreSQL server and find the flag!
# Solution  
This flag required to launch an instance on demand. After launching it, the picoCTF flag page provided connection details to connect to the instantiated PostgreSQL server console. The connection was provided with root privileges so the only thing left for us to do was to search through the database for the flag.  
Searching for available databases, then for available tables and finally the content of those tables resulted in to the flag.
